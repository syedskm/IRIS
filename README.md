# IRIS
End-to-end ML project demonstrating data visualization, preprocessing, and model training on the Iris dataset

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow to classify Iris flowers into their species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. It serves as a portfolio piece showcasing foundational data science and machine learning skills.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower. I've used the famous Iris dataset, a classic in the machine learning community, to illustrate an end-to-end process, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model evaluation.

### Key Skills Demonstrated:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.

* Data Preprocessing: Handling data formats and preparing it for model training.

* Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

* Model Performance Metrics: Using metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and a Classification Report to assess and interpret the model's performance.

I'd be glad to. Here is a complete and professional README for your Iris classification project, ready to be used in your Git repository.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower. I've used the famous Iris dataset, a classic in the machine learning community, to illustrate an end-to-end process, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model evaluation.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing: Handling data formats and preparing it for model training.

Model Training & Evaluation: Implementing and comparing multiple classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance to achieve the best possible results.

Model Performance Metrics: Using metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and a Classification Report to assess and interpret the model's performance.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following libraries and tools:

**Python: ** The core programming language.

**Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

**Scikit-learn: **For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

**Jupyter Notebook:** For an interactive and reproducible development environment.


## Results
After training and evaluating multiple models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier achieved the highest accuracy.

Model Performance:

Model: K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

Accuracy: 98% on the test dataset

Here is a visualization of the data distribution, which was key to understanding the features and their relationships:
